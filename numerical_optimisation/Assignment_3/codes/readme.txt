Demonstration file solution.m takes roughly 40 seconds to run. 

Support functions are:

phi_fourier_half_plane.m -> returns real and im components of 2D FFT on upper half plane of transform domain.
phi_t_fourier_half_plane.m -> returns real and im components of 2D FFT on bottom half plane of transform domain.
LineMask.m -> by Justin Romberg. generates k-space frequencies used in the sampling pattern. 
logbar_L1.m -> log-barrier algorithm for l1 minimisation with quadratic constraints.
logbar_TV.m -> log-barrier algorithm for TV minimisation with quadratic constraints
primal_dual_L1.m -> primal-dual algorithm for L1 minimisation with equality constraints.

Thank you,
